Extracting HI 21-cm signal from the composite sky averaged signal using nonparametric methods

Exploring the idea of extracting HI 21-cm signal from the overwhelming composite sky averaged signal, including
foreground and ionospheric effects such as refraction, absorption, and thermal emission from the ionosphere’s F and
D-layers using different non-parametric methods like Gaussian processes and trend filtering.
